    "### 18\n",
    "At times potentially non-representitive data is used to train a model because it is more readily available than representative data.  The train-dev dataset is composed of a sample of this non-representative data that was not used for training, and allows you to distingish between failures to generalize due to overfitting and failures to generalize secondary to this non-representative data.  \n",
