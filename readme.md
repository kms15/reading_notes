# Reading notes

This is a personal collection of (sometimes executable) notes on things I happen to be reading.  As such, I will make no promises on the clarity or correctness of the contents.  The contents are unlikely to be of interest to anyone else, but if you find something here is useful feel free to use it (under an MIT license).
